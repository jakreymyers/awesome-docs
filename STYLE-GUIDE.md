# Style Guide for Documentation Templates

This brief style guide provides the 20% high-value writing tips which address 80% of the value.
For more comprehensive advice, refer to the [Google Developer Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) and the [Documentation Style Guide for GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/documentation/styleguide/).

## General recommendations

Apply the  following recommendations as you see fit.

### How to apply the recommendations in this style guide

Each section contains:

* Recommendations: follow these recommendations when writing templates.
If there isn't a recommendation on this style guide, then fall back to one of the parent style guides.
* Checklist: before submitting a merge request, use the checklists to verify your deliverable.
Reviewers use these checklists as criteria to accept or reject an MR.
* Sources:  one of the parent style guides where you can find similar guidance and examples, if at all.

### Write for the audience

When you write, ask the following questions:

* Who am I writing for?
* What assumptions can I make about the audience when I write for them? In other words, what does the audience already know about the subject and what does the audience need to know?
* Can I anticipate questions the audience might have?
* What's the best outcome for the audience? What do I need to say to get this outcome? For example, to use a template, one needs to download the template file and ideally follow the instructions on the guide of that template.
We want people to use the template and the guide together because of clarity (best outcome) and that's why one can find the following instruction at the top of a guide: "​​{Before using this template, read the accompanying…".

#### Checklist: Does the topic target the audience appropriately?

Please, let us know if there are any updates so we can update this section.

#### Voice and tone

The current voice and tone of the this project is mildly casual, serious, but not overly serious, and warm and approachable.
It makes sense to use the same voice and tone when writing templates.

### Be consistent

Always refer to a feature, a concept, or an object with the same term.
For example, avoid using 'username' and 'user ID' interchangeably, or avoid using 'user' and 'reader', or avoid referring to Microsoft 'Teams' and then refer to 'teams'.

### Abbreviations

Spell out an abbreviation in the first occurrence of it on a topic.
Remember that a topic is a self-contained section of a documentation as in DITA topics or a documentation type in Diataxis.
You might have to spell out the same abbreviation across topics of the same documentation because you can't assume that people will have read it on another topic, even if that topic is the 'Getting started' topic.

Exceptions: acronyms that are established in the industry, for example, WWW, TCP/IP, URL, and others.

Avoid creating unnecessary abbreviations.

<table>

   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>

### Plain language

Plain language means that you write with words that the audience can immediately understand when they read the text the first time.

Apply the following principles:

* Use consistent language, spelling, and tone throughout your docs.
* Describe things as clearly and accurately as possible.
* Run your text through a grammar [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) to check how readable it is.
  * Tools like Grammarly help you identify grammar issues
  * Tools like `Vale` help you identify style issues. ([This article](https://hackernoon.com/lint-lint-and-away-linters-for-the-english-language-70f4b22cc73c) includes a list of other linter tools.)
* Avoid colloquialisms and jargon because it makes it harder for a non-native English speaker to understand your words.
* Avoid adding your own opinions, or the opinions of others. Doing this clouds a reader's ability to draw conclusions from the documentation.
* If you are repeatedly using terms throughout a large article, you can define them once and then use them repeatedly in the body of the article.

#### Write short to medium sentences most of the time

In general, short sentences are easier to write and easier to read.
Sometimes, medium sentences are required for complex explanations.
Long sentences might require the reader to read instead of scanning, be mindful and choose long sentences only if absolutely necessary.

Every word must have earned its place in a text.
If you can cut a word because it is not justified in the text, cut it.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>When the process of freeing a vehicle that has been stuck results in ruts or holes, the operator will fill the rut or hole created by such activity before removing the vehicle from the immediate area.
   </td>
   <td>If you make a hole while freeing a stuck vehicle, you must fill the hole before you drive away.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Write in the simplest tense

Typically, the simplest tense is present tense.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>To register a user, configure the system first.
   </td>
   <td>To register a user, you will need to configure the system first.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Avoid passive voice when writing instructions

If you want users to perform an instruction, tell them so.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>You must install Docker.
   </td>
   <td>Docker should be installed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Configure the Oracle instances.
   </td>
   <td>If the Oracle instances haven't been configured yet, then they will need to be.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Write for easier translation

Clustering words might be difficult to translate.
Do not cluster more than 3 words.
You can break a cluster of words using prepositions such as 'of', 'for', and 'with'.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Readme documentation of the Terra service OR Readme of the Terra service
   </td>
   <td>Terra service readme documentation
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Don`t use metaphors, figures of speech, slangs, or jargons.

### Capitalize consistently

 To keep the documentation that you are writing consistent, use capitalization consistently.

Typically, style guides have many rules for capitalization, but to keep this style guide concise, use the following rules:

* Use sentence case for:
  * Titles and headings
  * Lists
  * Table elements like headings, labels, and captions
  * Image legends
* Match the capitalization of the UI when referring to it.
* Check the capitalization of the product that you are writing about and use the same capitalization that the product website uses throughout the document.
If the product or feature that you are writing about is in your project, then define the capitalization and use it consistently.
* Do not use capitalization unnecessarily.
Use 'cloud' instead of 'Cloud', 'service' instead of 'Service', 'project' instead of 'Project', and so on.

### Information organization

The most important information comes first in a page, topic, section, or sentence.

![alt_text](images/importance.png "Order of importance")

Source: [https://coolerinsights.com/2021/02/writing-social-media-guide/](https://coolerinsights.com/2021/02/writing-social-media-guide)

When users read the most important information first, you make them focus from the first line.
Users can decide at any point if the topic is not of interest, choose not to read it and still leave with the main message.

Also, since the first sentences appear in search results, it makes sense to have the most important information there because that's what users will see in a list of search results.

So for pages, topics, and sections, put the most important information first, followed by additional details, and then nice-to-know information.
This way of presenting information is also known as inverted pyramid, as depicted in the diagram.

#### How to write sentences with the most important information first

In sentences, information that clears any doubts about the context is as important as the main message.
So, in sentences, put contextual information like goal, location, or condition first.

If these things come at the end of the sentence, there is a great likelihood that users might need to read the text twice: the first time for the meaning of the sentence, and the second time to add the context.

##### Goal

If you are writing about a goal that the user is trying to achieve, then write the goal first.

Example 1: The goal is to create a user account.
Users who are not interested in creating an account can skip the text about the account creation process.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>To create an account</strong>, provide your email address and choose a password.
    We will verify your email address.
    Once verified, you can access all features of the platform.
   </td>
   <td>The process of account creation begins with providing your email address and password.
    Verification of the email address is required.
    After verification is complete, access to all platform features becomes available.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Example 2: The goal is to edit system-defined metadata of an object.
Users need to know why they are performing instructions before they do.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>To edit system-defined metadata of an object</strong>:
<p>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/</a>.
<p>
2. Navigate to your Amazon S3 bucket or folder and select the check box to the left of the names of the objects with metadata you want to edit.
   </td>
   <td>1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/</a>.
<p>
2. Navigate to your Amazon S3 bucket or folder and select the check box to the left of the names of the objects with metadata you want to edit.
<p>
3. Select Save <strong>to save the system-defined metadata of an object.</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Location

When you tell users to follow instructions, tell them where this is going to happen.

Example 1:  Tell the user where things happen in the UI.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Edit** actions, and choose **Edit metadata**.
   </td>
   <td>1. Choose **Edit metadata** on the **Actions** menu> **Edit metadata**.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Example 2:  Tell the user where things happen in the command line.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1. On your **home directory**, type command.
   </td>
   <td> 1. On the terminal, type command.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Condition

If a condition applies to a subset of the audience, write it first, so users to whom the condition doesn't apply can skip the text.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>For printing color reproductions locally</strong>, use a high-resolution laser or wax-transfer printer that has at least 1MB of memory.
   </td>
   <td><strong>For local PC printing</strong>, it is recommended that you use a high-resolution laser or wax-transfer type printer <strong>for color reproductions</strong>, and that the printer have at least 1 MB of memory.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Unless you have already submitted an up-to-date resume</strong>, you must submit a resume containing your undergraduate, graduate, and any other professional education, your work experience in the field of health care, and the name, address and phone number of current and previous employers in the healthcare field.
   </td>
   <td>With your grant application you must submit a resume containing your undergraduate, graduate, and any other professional education, your work experience in the field of health care, and the name, and phone number of current and previous employers in the healthcare field, <strong>unless you have already submitted this information</strong>.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Checklist for information organization

  <tr>
   <td>Guideline
   </td>
   <td>Check
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Goal comes first in a sentence
   </td>
   <td>Did you make sure that you contextualized sentences based on the goal (if any)?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Location comes first in a sentence
   </td>
   <td>Did you make sure users know where to find the information in the UI?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Condition comes first in a sentence
   </td>
   <td>Did you make sure that conditions came first (if any)?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Most important information comes first
   </td>
   <td>Did you make sure that you placed the most important information first in the topic, section, or page?
   </td>
  </tr>

### Writing procedural steps

Here are some recommendations you can use when creating procedural steps:

* For procedures with numerous steps, consider "chunking" content into sub-sections of 5-10 steps. It makes the information easier to read and remember, and gives the reader a sense of accomplishment after each chunk is completed. Chunking is recommended by major companies, such as in [Microsoft's writing style guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/writing-step-by-step-instructions#complex-procedures), and from the Nielsen Norman Group's [research on chunking and usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/short-term-memory-and-web-usability/).
* Each step is a single sentence (you should be able to read it aloud, and it should make grammatical sense).
* When describing a step, include a lead-in sentence to remind the reader what they will be doing when following the sub-steps.
* Aim for no more than four sub-steps in any primary step.
* If you are indenting sub-steps beyond one indent level, break out your steps into a new main step block.
* Too many sub-steps could suggest that you need to break out some of these steps into a new step section.
* Screenshots and images are recommended, particularly if you can include call outs to the specific parts of the screen you are referring to.
* Identify steps that are optional by using typing _Optional_ followed by a colon. For example,
  * Optional: Enter a description for your repository.
* Use conditional clause _if (condition) then (result)_  to identify steps that are applicable only if certain criteria apply. Always start the conditional steps with a condition so that users who do not meet the condition can skip the step. For example,
  * If you are a Windows user, then install the VM VirtualBox software on your machine.

For more information on writing procedures, see [Google developer documentation style guide.](https://developers.google.com/style/procedures)

### Page structure and organization

* Create an outline of the headings you want to include in the document before you start writing.
  * Use the outline to gather your thoughts about the main topics you need to tell your readers.
  * It's a lot easier to move things around with headings than to move blocks of content.
* You may also find that you need to create two articles if the subject starts to branch.
* Add any links you mention in the body of your content into the "See also" section. The inline links may get lost in long articles, and scanning for links adds to your audience's cognitive load.

### Titles and filenames

* Make the title descriptive of the content contained within the article.
* Make the title unique within your application space.
* Make the title and filename the same: it makes it difficult to identify the file name when the title and filename differ.
* Use unique words in titles so you can search and replace text later on without getting fuzzy matches.

Here are some title examples and their suggested file name structures:

* Using a toaster
  * `using-a-toaster.md`
  * `using-a-toaster.adoc`
* Toast a slice of bread
  * `toast-slice-of-bread.md`
  * `toast-slice-of-bread.adoc`

### Links

A helpful link is up to date, not broken, it empowers users to choose to follow it BEFORE they do, and is placed where it is needed and not where it can become a distraction.

#### How to write up-to-date links

When linking to another topic, whenever possible and in particular to an external site, use a low-risk link or a medium-risk link.
These links have a lower risk of being outdated or broken than linking directly to an internal document in an external site.
This is particularly important in documentation projects where writers are volunteers and might not be around when the link needs updating.

The following table explains the types of links and the risk of the link to be outdated or broken, how to write that type of link, and an example for each type of link.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Risk
   </td>
   <td>How to write
   </td>
   <td>Example
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Low risk
   </td>
   <td>Do not hyperlink, but explain how to find the information.
   </td>
   <td>To read about how to register an app with Firebase, go to the Firebase website and search for 'register app Firebase'.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Medium risk
   </td>
   <td>Hyperlink to the website, and explain how to search for the information.
   </td>
   <td>To read about how to register an app with Firebase, go to `Firebase https://firebase.google.com/`_ and search for 'register app Firebase'.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>High risk
   </td>
   <td>Hyperlink to a specific topic
   </td>
   <td>To read about how to register an app with Firebase, go to `Add Firebase to your Apple project https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#register-app`_.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

When you write the resources deliverable for the template project, try to use medium-risk links, when possible.

When linking to internal topics, it is less problematic to use high risk links than when linking externally.
That is because the likelihood that internally changed links will be updated or noticed early is higher than when a link changes externally.
For example, you can use a link to a template deliverable.
See the
[resources section](#resources) of the template deliverables.

#### Accessed on

With each external link, Give the reader an indication of when you accessed the link:

Accessed on _date on which the link was accessed_.

#### How users can choose to follow the link before they do

When creating links, unless the link text is self-explanatory, create links with context.
Tell people why they'd follow a link before they click on it by adding introductory information with the link.
It is just a small sentence for you, but it saves people the trouble of following the link and scanning the page to find out why the link is there and if they did want to read the page.

You can add context to links using the following ways:

* Write a descriptive phrase that provides context for the topic that you're linking to.
* Write link text that portraits the content of the topic that you're linking to.
Ideally, the link text would match the topic heading on the target page.

See some examples of not so helpful links and how to fix them.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Not so helpful link
   </td>
   <td>Problem
   </td>
   <td>Solution
   </td>

#### Where to place a hyperlink

Links can be distracting, especially if placed in places where people don't need them.

* For instructions that the user must follow to complete a step, place the link in the step where it is needed.
* For supporting information, create a section called 'Related topics' at the bottom of the page and place links with supporting information, related topics, and nice-to-know information in there.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Guideline
   </td>
   <td>Check
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If possible, use low-risk links for external documentation.
   </td>
   <td>Did you choose low-risk or medium risk, over high risk links whenever possible?
   </td>
  </tr>

   </td>
   <td>Did you place essential links next to the text where it is needed? Did you place links with supporting information in a section for related information?
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Lists

The simplest guideline for lists is: use numbered lists for a sequence of instructions or anything that requires order.
Use bulleted lists for everything else.

Other recommendations:

* Introduce the list with an introductory sentence.
* Use parallel phrasing.
* For inline lists, use the Oxford comma.

#### Introductory sentence

To clear any assumptions about the content of the list, write a complete sentence to introduce the list.

Example 1: No introductory sentence X introductory sentence

<ul>

<li>Super VM

<li>VM center

<li>VM Advantage
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Numbered lists

Use numbered lists for instructions or anything that requires order.

Example 1:  Numbered list for instructions

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ol>

<li>On the bottom of the **Fields List** pane on the left, click **Add a Field**.
       2. Search your field by address, zip code, latitude/longitude, or CLUs (common land units) that appear as outlined grids of land.
<p>
       3. To organize your field information in your account, type a **Field Name**, **Client Name**, **Farm Name** and **Approximate Area** of the field.
<p>

</li>
</ol>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Click **Add a Field** on the bottom of the **Fields List** pane on the left.

<li>Search your field by address, zip code or latitude/longitude or by CLUs (common land units) that will appear as outlined grids of land.

<li>Provide a **Field Name**, **Client Name**, **Farm Name** and **Approximate Area** of the field in order to keep your field information organized in your account.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Bulleted lists

When the order of the items of a list is interchangeable, use a bulleted list.

Example 1:  Bulleted list for a series of items that can be listed in any order

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The retention policy is the following:
<ul>

<li>Slack - 30 days for Chat, 4yrs for channels, 4yrs for files

<li>Gmail attachments - 2yrs for active accounts, 6mths for non-active accounts
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>The retention policy is the following:
<p>
1. Slack - 30 days for Chat, 4yrs for channels, 4yrs for files
<p>
2. Gmail attachments - 2yrs for active accounts, 6mths for non-active accounts
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Inline lists

When you want to write inline lists with 3 or more items, use the Oxford comma.

Example 1: Use the Oxford comma when you want to list 3 or more items in a list.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>2 items in a list
   </td>
   <td>3 items in a list
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Turn the system on. Press a, b and c.
   </td>
   <td>Turn the system on. Press a, b, and c.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Parallel phrasing

Use the same syntax or structure for list items.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Do
   </td>
   <td>Don't
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Things I should eat:
<ul>

<li>Vegetables

<li>Beans

<li>Fruits
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>Things that I eat:
<ul>

<li>I eat chocolate.

<li>Nutella

<li>The other day I also ate ice cream.

<li>Cheesecake is great!
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Checklist for lists

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Guideline
   </td>
   <td>Check
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Write an introductory sentence
   </td>
   <td>Does the list have an introductory sentence?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use numbered lists when the order is important
   </td>
   <td>Is the numbered list wrong if the items are listed out of the current order?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use bullet lists for non-ordered items
   </td>
   <td>Can the items be listed in any order?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use oxford comma
   </td>
   <td>Does the inline list have three or more items?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use parallel phrasing
   </td>
   <td>Does the list present the same structure for all items?
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tables

Markdown tables work best for simple tables.
Because of the many limitations that Markdown tables have for complex tables, prefer bullet lists over tables whenever possible.

Use a table in the following cases:

* The information consists of two or more parts whose relationship is best captured in a table.
* The tabular format brings out or highlights information in such a way that lists can't capture.
* The table saves a lot of words because there is a clear pattern established by the table that avoids repeating words.

#### Introductory sentence

Just like with lists, to clear any assumptions about the content of the table, write a complete sentence to introduce the table, unless the table comes right after a heading and the heading is sufficiently descriptive.
For example, the checklist tables in this document.

#### Table header

Tables must have a header.
Use sentence style to capitalize the header.

#### Checklist for tables

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Guideline
   </td>
   <td>Check
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use a list whenever possible
   </td>
   <td>Can the table be written as a list?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use a table for two or more parts of information
   </td>
   <td>Does the table contain two or more parts?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use a table to bring out more information
   </td>
   <td>Does the table bring out information?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use a table to save repeating words
   </td>
   <td>Does the table save words significantly?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Write an introductory sentence
   </td>
   <td>Does the table have an introductory sentence?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Add a table header
   </td>
   <td>Does the table have a header?
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Notes

Use notes sparingly.
Too many and the topic becomes crowded.
A rough guide is one note per topic.

Put notes where users are likely to see them or when users are likely to need them.

### Where to place notes

* Right before an instruction or a text where the note applies, not after.
* Before tables, images, or graphs.
* At the beginning of a section or topic, not after.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
Do

   <td>Don't

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Types of notes

Use the following list to add notes, ordered by from least important to most important:

* Tip: Information that might help a user.
* Caution: Crucial information, proceed with caution.
* Warning:  Negative consequences of an action, including data loss.

Guidance for notes in template guides: {ALL CAPS: tip}  can be deleted by the users of the template when they fill in the template.

Each template deliverable is explained in the following sections.

### Template file

Naming convention: template\__content-type_.md

where:

* template is a constant.
* _content-type_ is the specific subject that the template is about, for example, template_memo.md is a template for memos.

The template file is the basic template for the type of document you are creating.
It provides a rough outline of the suggested content and a few embedded writing tips for how to fill in the different sections of the template.
The template user will copy this template and begin filling it in or editing it as their starting point in the writing process.

#### Content and formatting guidelines

Each template must have this content:

* **The template title** - The type of document this template is for.
For example, "Tutorial template" or "README template."" This title must be formatted with the heading 1 weight.
* **Introductory comment** - Include an embedded writing tip at the start that tells users they should first read the accompanying template guide before they fill in the template.
Put introductory comments in {curly brackets}.
* **The template sections** - Each section of the template should begin with a heading with the heading 2 weight.
The recommended content and some embedded writing tips fall under the headings.
* **Embedded writing tips** - You can provide some lightweight writing tips that provide some tips or hints about what kind of content the template user might choose to put in a section of the document.
Put embedded writing tips in {curly brackets}.

🚩 **NOTE: The basic content of the template depends on the type of document you are creating a template for.
Different types of documents can have widely varying content needs.
While similar document types are likely to require similar structures, other document types may be structured quite differently.**

#### Frequently asked questions

**Q: Is it better to include all the possible sections that someone could possibly include in the template file or should it just have the most common sections?**

A: While this is mostly a judgment call on your part as the template author, it might be better to err on the side of being comprehensive.
Don't forget that in your template guide you can indicate whether it is common or recommended to include this section or not.

**Q: Can I use heading 3 weights for sub-sections?**

A: Yes, but try not to go much deeper than level 3.

### Template guide

Naming convention: guide\__content-type_.md

where:

* guide is a constant.
* _content-type_ is the specific subject that the template is about, for example, guide_memo.md is the guide for the memo template.

The guide provides a deeper explanation of how to fill in each section of the template.
This guide explains the key decisions that the template user needs to make during the writing process.

The guide might also optionally include a checklist of the required components for this type of document.

#### Content and formatting guidelines

The template guide must follow the same basic structure:

* **Template guide title** - The type of document this template is for and the words "guide." For example, "Tutorial guide" or "README guide." This title must be formatted with the heading 1 weight.
* **Introductory comment** - Include an embedded writing tip at the start that tells users they should first read this guide before they fill in the template.
This comment could also mention how to get the template file.
Put introductory comments in {curly brackets}.
* **Why do I need this type of document?** - Provide some of the information about the purpose of this type of document and how it helps your documentation project.
The header for this section should be formatted with the heading 2 weight.
* **Content of this template** - This header marks the beginning of the part of the guide that explains how to fill in each section of the guide.
It should be formatted with the heading 2 weight.
* **About the {insert section name here} section** - Next, include each section as they appear in the template with the heading 3 weight.
For example, if your template includes a "Before you start" section, this heading should say "About the before your start section." And then it should provide guidance about what kind of content goes in that section and why that section might be included in the final document.
If the section is optional, indicate why some documents could benefit from that section or why it might be left out.
If the template user needs to make a decision about the content in that section, provide guidance about what should go into that section.

### Resources

Naming convention: resources\__content-type_.md

Where:

* resources is a constant.
* _content-type_ is the specific subject that the template is about, for example, resources_memo.md is the resource file for the memo template.
