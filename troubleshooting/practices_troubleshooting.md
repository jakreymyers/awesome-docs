# Best Practices: Troubleshooting

>Before using [Template: Troubleshooting](./template_troubleshooting.md), read this for best practices about how to research, write, and maintain this type of content.

## How to research Troubleshooting

Your organization's support team play a major role in this step of creating your product's troubleshooting guide. They have the closest relationships with your product's users, so it's important to collaborate with them in creating the content for your guide. Consider using the following strategies to facilitate this process:

* Analyze support tickets and ask one or more of the members of the support team which issues need to be addressed the most. This could be done using a survey, a discussion thread, or through another method your support team prefers.
* Analyze comments in product's discussion forums and request the support team's advice on which feature needs the most support. This could be done using a survey, a discussion thread, etc.
* Analyze customer reviews of products and work with the support team to pick the ones that require more attention.

## How to write troubleshooting guides

While making your guide's content easy to read is necessary, you don't want to come off as patronizing to your users. For example, calling the guide "easy to use" or "simple" can make them feel like children, causing them to lose interest in reading. Here are other methods to use when writing your troubleshooting guide:

* Use descriptive headings when describing the symptoms and causes of your issue. Also, place them in chronological order and hyperlink them to make it easier for users to navigate through the guide.
* Place a brief explanation underneath the cause's heading to help users understand why the symptoms are occurring.
* Use active voice when describing issues and steps.

## How to maintain troubleshooting guides

Just like in the creation process, your organization's support team's insight is needed to maintain the guide. When comes time to work with this team albeit a discussion thread or a daily meeting, it's highly recommended to use the information mentioned in the [research section](#how-to-research-troubleshooting) of this template and use the following questions to guide the conversation:

* Which steps in the guide need more clarity and/or revision?
* What information is irrelevant to the current version of the guide?
* How can we make this guide more interactive?
It's also helpful to conduct a document review meeting with the support team after a week or two after a release of the document. This would ensure that the document meets the demands of customers, especially the support inquiries has changed.
