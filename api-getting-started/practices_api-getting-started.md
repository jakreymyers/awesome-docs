# Best Practices: API Getting Started

>Before using [Template: Getting Started with the {Product} API](./template_api-getting-started.md), read this for best practices about how to research, write, and maintain this type of content.

## How do you know if you need an API getting started guide?

An API getting started guide is targeted at users who have domain knowledge and need to quickly learn how to use an API. It provides a structured introduction to help them get up and running efficiently.

You need a getting started guide for your API if:

* The API has key workflows or setup steps that users must understand before making requests.
* You want to reduce onboarding time and improve developer adoption.
* Your API is part of a larger ecosystem, and users need guidance on integrating it with other services.

## How to determine what content an API getting started needs

The API getting started template covers the essential components needed for the documentation, such as authentication, requests and response examples, and code blocks. Use the following guidance to enhance the content further:

* Identify the users (internal or external) and their domain, needs, and goals.
* Identify the primary functional requirements of the API--that's, the business capabilities the API enables.
* Test and understand how the API works yourself to know if you're not leaving out important information in the guide.
* Identify the most common use cases of the API and focus the guide on those cases. You can use some of the following tips:
  * Review the getting started guide and documentation of similar APIs in the same domain or industry.
  * Analyze your company's support requests and user feedback.
  * Speak with stakeholders, such as developers, product managers, or business analysts.
  * If the API has usage analytics or metrics available, analyze them to identify the most frequently used endpoints or functionalities.

## Audience goals

It's important to identify the audience and their goals so that the API getting started guide provides the most relevant information for the user. These documents are typically targeted for developers. With this in mind, provide information so that they can get started quickly with key information and links to additional information to expand their knowledge of the API.

## How to introduce an API getting started guide

Getting started guides typically describe the primary functional requirements of the API or the business capabilities it enables to help developers understand what they can achieve with it. Use the "Introduction" section to provide a clear overview of what developers can achieve with the API. Keep it concise but informative, focusing on key features and practical use cases.

Refer to the [Resources document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s__uFWhkMwWy5qKqTXY4gDaJvC62wCuz499dnC_YyRY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.utjrcnv3sr22) for examples and best practices on structuring the introduction effectively.

## How to write an API getting started guide

* Include an overview of the capabilities of the API and its benefits to the user or business. See [How to introduce an getting started guide](#how-to-introduce-an-api-getting-started-guide).
* Ensure the steps in the guide are clear, concise, and complete.
* If the guide contains code samples, make sure to verify they work as intended and include their outputs as well.
* Include the desired end result from completing the guide so that users can assess whether they were successful or not.
* Test the getting started guide with someone who was not involved with creating the API.

## How to maintain an API getting started guide

* Update code samples as the API evolves. Consult relevant stakeholders whenever a new release occurs or changes happen and update the API getting started accordingly.
* Periodically review the getting started guide to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and easy to follow.
* Incorporate a feedback mechanism from users to enhance the quality of the guide and improve user experience.
* Embrace versioning. If your API has different versions, ensure the quick start guide clearly specifies which version it relates to.
