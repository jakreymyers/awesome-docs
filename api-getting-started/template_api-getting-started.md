## Overview

This guide walks you through getting started with the {name of your product} API to {explain what the user will do or accomplish in the guide, such as making GET or POST requests, using the API to create an app, and so on}.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

* {Objective 1}
* {Objective 2}
* {Objective 3}

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you:

* Are familiar with {explain the relevant concepts or experience the user needs to have to use the API, such as the REST API experience}.
* Have the following tools installed or set up:
  * {Software Prerequisite 1}
  * {Software Prerequisite 2}

## Authentication

Making a request to the {product name} API requires authentication. Follow these steps to access to the API:

1. {Sign up for an account}
2. {Request for an API key}
3. {Additional steps as necessary}

## Base URL

The base URL for all requests to the API is:

```text
{https://api.example.com/v2}
```

## Make your first API request

This section demonstrates how to make your first API request to the {product name} API.
To make your first API request:

1. Select an API endpoint. See the API reference document for a list of endpoints.
2. Use cURL or Postman to make a request.

### Request

The following is a sample POST request that sends some sample data to the `tasks` endpoint using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/1.0/tasks" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "data": {
      "workspace": "WORKSPACE_GID",
      "name": "Sample task",
      "assignee": "me"
    }
}'
```

{The above example code is a boilerplate so ensure you replace it with your own.}

### Response

The following is a sample JSON response from the API:

```bash
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Task created successfully.",
  "data": {
    "id": "TASK_GID",
    "workspace": "WORKSPACE_GID",
    "name": "Sample task",
    "assignee": {
      "id": "USER_GID",
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
  "created_at": "2025-02-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-02-01T12:00:00Z",
  "due_date": null,
  "completed": false
  }
}
```

{The above example code is a boilerplate so ensure you replace it with your own.}
