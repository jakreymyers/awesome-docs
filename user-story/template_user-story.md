1. {Acceptance criterion 1: Specific condition that must be met}
2. {Acceptance criterion 2: Specific condition that must be met}
3. {Acceptance criterion 3: Specific condition that must be met}
4. {Additional acceptance criteria as needed}

## Tasks and Subtasks

{Break down the story into specific tasks and subtasks needed for implementation. Reference applicable acceptance criteria numbers where relevant.}

- [ ] Task 1 {(AC: {number} if applicable)}
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: {Specific implementation detail}
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: {Specific implementation detail}
- [ ] Task 2 {(AC: {number} if applicable)}
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: {Specific implementation detail}
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: {Specific implementation detail}
- [ ] Task 3 {(AC: {number} if applicable)}
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: {Specific implementation detail}
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: {Specific implementation detail}

{Continue adding tasks and subtasks as needed to fully implement the user story}
