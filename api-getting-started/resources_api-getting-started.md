## Examples of API getting started guides

* [**GitHub Rest API Getting Started Guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api): The GitHub Rest API getting started guide includes most of the necessary sections in a typical getting started guide. It also explains the steps involved in achieving the objectives of the document in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, the guide provides detailed explanations of the key elements that make up an API request, such as HTTP methods, paths, headers, and more.
* [**ClickUp's Getting Started Guide**](https://developer.clickup.com/docs/index): It's common practice for a getting started guide to span multiple pages or documents. The ClickUp getting started guide divides into four sections. These include: a step-by-step guide on setting up authentication for the API, a demo application demonstrating how to integrate the ClickUp API, a downloadable Postman Collection that allows users to explore and make requests to the API, and a page explaining how to test the API directly in a web browser.
* [**Facebook Graph API Getting Started Guide**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started): This guide makes good use of screenshots to visually demonstrate how to use the Graph API Explorer tool, making it easier for users to follow along and understand the process.
